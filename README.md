# current_posts
a simple module of posts (Drupal 7) from the last two days.

The full tutorial is located at https://www.drupal.org/node/1074360

I have followed the tutorial to understand the basics of the module development for Drupal 7.x
The only thing I have changed is the custome function which shows the post not from the last week
but from the last two days
